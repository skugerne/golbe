# golbe

This is a project to learn some Go, make a globe, and perhaps eventually do something interesting on the surface of said globe.  Perhaps a little ecosystem sim.  Screaming my frustrations into the uncaring void that is the internet: why don't hex-based Civ games take place on a globe (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldberg_polyhedron)?

The project g3n (https://github.com/g3n/engine) appears to provide an excellent starting point, taking care of everything I can think I might need.
